# Project: Company and User Mapping with Google Maps API

## Overview

This project is a TypeScript-based application that demonstrates the integration of Google Maps API to display markers for dynamically generated companies and users. The app utilizes `faker.js` to create random data for companies and users, including their names, catchphrases, and geographic locations (latitude and longitude). When clicking on a marker, an info window pops up with details about the respective company or user.

## Features

- **TypeScript Integration**: The project is built using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and better code management.
- **Google Maps API**: The map is rendered using Google Maps API, with custom markers added for users and companies.
- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Randomized data is generated using `faker.js` for companies and users, providing unique names, catchphrases, and locations.
- **Custom Info Windows**: Clickable markers show information about the entity (company or user) in a popup window.

## Project Structure

- **`index.ts`**: Main entry point of the app. Initializes the map and adds markers for a user and a company.
- **`CustomMap.ts`**: Handles the Google Maps logic, providing methods to add markers to the map.
- **`Company.ts`**: Defines the `Company` class, which implements the `Mappable` interface. Each company is assigned a name, catchphrase, and location.
- **`User.ts`**: Defines the `User` class, which also implements the `Mappable` interface. Each user is assigned a name and location.
- **`index.html`**: Contains the basic HTML structure with a `<div>` to hold the map.

## How It Works

1. **Google Maps Initialization**: The `CustomMap` class creates a Google Map centered at coordinates (0, 0) with a zoom level of 1.
2. **Adding Markers**: Using the `addMarker` method, markers are added to the map for the `User` and `Company` instances. These markers are positioned based on the generated lat/lng data.
3. **Info Windows**: Clicking on a marker opens an info window that displays either the companyâ€™s name and catchphrase or the user's name.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and robust development experience.
- **Google Maps API**: Powers the map functionality and marker rendering.
- **Faker.js**: Generates random names, catchphrases, and locations for companies and users.

## Dependencies

- `faker`: ^5.5.3
